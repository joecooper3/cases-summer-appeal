                    youth age 12 to 24 and men and women including several hundred
                    with serious mental illness. Every day, CASES’ programs engage

                <p>That’s roughly the cost of operating Rikers Island for 7 days, according
                    to a NYC Comptroller report last November stating the daily cost
                    of operating the jail is about $3.73 million. At this rate, <strong>the cost of operating
                Rikers Island for 1 week—$26 million—would more than pay for 1 year of
                operating CASES</strong>, which has a current annual budget of about
                    $24 million.

                    jail and prison; and neighborhood-based services to support reentry.
                    CASES will also continue to provide a range of behavioral health
                    services including at our Harlem mental health clinic and via
                    mobile treatment teams annually making about 20,000 clients visits

        <p>We seek justice and healing for all our clients, and we work one case at
            a time in order to build on individual strengths and goals while addressing
            unique risks and needs. While CASES works closely with government agencies
            to improve the system from within, we also develop and implement innovative
            strategies to address emerging needs and gaps not yet recognized by public
            agencies. To create these innovative solutions to some of the most difficult
            public safety and public health challenges, CASES relies on private support
            including foundation and corporate grants and individual donations.</p>
